# e-GAI & p-RAI Methods

This repository provides an R implementation of the **e-GAI** and **p-RAI** methods in paper "e-GAI: e-value-based Generalized $\alpha$-Investing for Online False Discovery Rate Control".

## Overview

* **e-GAI-RAI**: The main function implementing the e-GAI (exponential Generalized Alpha-Investing) and RAI (Ranking Adaptive Interaction) algorithms.
* **mem-e-GAI**: Supplementary code for memory-efficient FDR control, building on the core e-GAI framework.

> **Note:** The codebase is under active development. Additional features, optimizations, and documentation will be added in upcoming releases.
